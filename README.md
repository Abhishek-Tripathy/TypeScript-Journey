# 📘 TypeScript Basics Repository

Welcome! This repository 📂 documents my journey in learning TypeScript from scratch. As someone with a background in JavaScript, my goal is to build a strong foundation in TypeScript's core concepts and gradually apply them to real-world coding scenarios. 🚀

## 🤔 Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers powerful type-checking features ✅, making JavaScript development more predictable and maintainable. Through this repo, I’ll explore how TypeScript can enhance my coding practices and improve application scalability. 

## 📈 Progress

I'll be updating this repository regularly as I dive into new concepts and complete coding exercises. Feel free to explore the code and track my progress as I advance through TypeScript!

## 🚀 Get Started


Thanks for visiting, and happy coding! 💻🌟

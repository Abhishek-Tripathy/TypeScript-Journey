# TypeScript Basics Repository

Welcome! This repository documents my journey in learning TypeScript from scratch. As someone with a background in JavaScript, my goal is to build a strong foundation in TypeScript's core concepts and gradually apply them to real-world coding scenarios.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers powerful type-checking features, making JavaScript development more predictable and maintainable. Through this repo, Iâ€™ll explore how TypeScript can enhance my coding practices and improve application scalability.

## Progress

I'll regularly update this repository as I dive into new concepts and complete coding exercises. Feel free to explore the code, and check out my progress as I advance through TypeScript!

## Get Started

Thanks for visiting, and happy coding!
